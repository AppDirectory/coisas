A pure-javascript kind of CMS for hosting multipurpose websites in GitHub pages.

_This is a work in progress with lots of bugs. And this repository is holding my personal webpage, which is also a work in progress._

## How it works:

Clone this, remove all the docs inside `docs`, remove `index.html` and all folders besides `assets`, `edit` and `docs`. Push it to GitHub and access it through your `githubusername.github.io/edit` (you can also access it through a project page such as `githubusername.github.io/project/edit`, just remember changing the branch name to `gh-pages`).

From there, add content and publish your work. `coisas` will render HTML pages according to the data you provide and the kinds you select, and push everything to GitHub.

Yes, it will ask for your password, but it is just for push the rendered pages to GitHub. It is not sent to anyone anywhere.
